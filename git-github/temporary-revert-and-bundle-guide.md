# How to Temporarily Revert to a Previous Commit, Create a Git Bundle, and Return to Your Work

**Question:**  
How can I temporarily revert to a previous commit, resend the git bundle, and then come back to my most recent changes and keep working?

---

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Find the Commit You Want to Revert To

Open your terminal and run:
```bash
git log --oneline
```
- This will show a list of recent commits.
- Copy the commit hash (e.g., `abc1234`) of the commit you want to revert to.

---

### 2. Checkout the Previous Commit (Detached HEAD)

```bash
git checkout abc1234
```
- This puts you in a "detached HEAD" state, which is safe for temporary work or exporting code.
- You can view or export the code as it existed at that commit.

---

### 3. Create and Send a Git Bundle

#### A. Create a Bundle of the Current State

To bundle just the current commit:
```bash
git bundle create ../myproject.bundle HEAD
```
To include all history:
```bash
git bundle create ../myproject.bundle --all
```

#### B. Send the Bundle

- Email, upload, or otherwise share the `myproject.bundle` file with your team.

---

### 4. Return to Your Most Recent Changes

#### A. Return to Your Working Branch

```bash
git checkout main
# or whatever branch you were working on
```

#### B. (Optional) If you made changes while in detached HEAD, you can stash or commit them before switching back.

---

### 5. Continue Working

You're now back on your latest branch with all your recent changes, ready to keep going.

## Tips

- If you want to make changes to the old commit and keep them, create a branch before switching back:
  ```bash
  git checkout -b temp-old-state
  ```
- Always make sure to return to your main branch (or your feature branch) to continue your latest work.
