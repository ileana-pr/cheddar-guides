| Prompt | Motivation | Why this works |
|---|---|---|
| Apply the "Five Whys." For each answer, ask "Why?" again until file layers deep. Finish with the root cause and one corrective action. | Have you ever found yourself figuring out why a project or plan sometimes implodes? Playing toddler with AI can help sniff out the root cause. It's super simple, have it ask "But why?" five times. | Bypasses surface-level issues to reveal underlying problems.<br><br>Prevents the same issues from recurring by addressing root causes, not symptoms.<br><br>The Five Whys technique goes as far back as Plato and most recently implemented by Toyota! |
| "I'm encountering a bug where [describe the bug and expected vs. actual behavior]. Walk me through debugging this like I'm a junior developer. Ask me questions to help me identify the root cause, rather than giving me the direct solution." | Instead of a quick fix, this helps you understand the debugging process, improving problem-solving skills. Forces critical thinking about the code. | Mimics the Socratic method, guiding you through logical steps. Encourages active learning and deeper understanding of codebase and error patterns. |
| "Explain this code snippet: ```[paste code snippet]``` as if you were explaining it to a 5-year-old (or a non-technical manager). Focus on the 'what' and 'why' in simple terms, avoiding jargon where possible." | Quickly grasp complex code or explain it to non-technical people. Great for onboarding or revisiting old code. | Forces simplification and analogy, making complex concepts digestible. Tests understanding by requiring high-level abstraction. |
| "Here's a piece of code that I feel could be improved: ```[paste code snippet]```. Suggest 3-5 potential refactorings, explaining the pros and cons of each. Consider aspects like readability, performance, and maintainability." | Get suggestions for improving existing code beyond just fixing bugs. Helps explore different design patterns and best practices. | Leverages AI's knowledge of design patterns and coding principles for concrete improvement suggestions. Pros/cons analysis aids informed decisions. |
| "Given this function/method: ```[paste function/method signature and a brief description of its purpose]```, generate a comprehensive list of test cases (unit tests). Include edge cases, typical inputs, and invalid inputs. For each test case, specify the input, expected output, and a brief rationale." | Save time writing test cases and ensure better coverage by identifying scenarios you might miss. | AI can systematically consider input domains and boundary conditions, often more exhaustively than humans, leading to robust code. |
| "I'm designing a system with [describe key components and interactions]. What are some potential failure points or 'what if' scenarios I should consider for [specific component or interaction]? For each, suggest a potential mitigation strategy." | Proactively identify risks and design a more resilient system. Helps think about edge cases and error handling early in design. | Simulates a "pre-mortem" by exploring potential problems. AI draws on vast data of system design patterns and common pitfalls. |
